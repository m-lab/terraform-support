# Timeout after 10h. Today, there are around 50 virtual machines in the
# production cluster. On average it takes a single VM around 6.5m to be
# deleted, recreated, and for ndt-server or the API to be available. If we
# update the machines serially, this means a total build time of around 5.5
# hours. Set the timeout to around double that just for room to grow.
